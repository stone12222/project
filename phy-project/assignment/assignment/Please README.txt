This is only for the assignment. If there is something wrong with the program pls contect me afsp and I'll try my best to fix it.

DISCLAIMERS(again)
The 100 meters track is to consider to be in a straight line. i.e. no curved track.
The race are only going to end if the participant has displaced 100 meters forward(start at start point and ends at the end point) and their distance traveled can be as large as you want
The speed I put in are the average speed I got based on the date we collect and we’re assuming that the participant are doing uniform motions at all time and their speed does not change in the middle of the race
There are may be a little variation when it comes to the program time and the time got from caulations since there is rounding in some part of the program because some time computer doesn’t like numbers that have decimals but I have try my best to minimize the variation to hundredth of seconds 
The number on the paper doing the math may not be the same number that I putted into the program because, those number hadapplied significant digit rules on them but for accuracy of the proving part significant digit rules will not be applied
